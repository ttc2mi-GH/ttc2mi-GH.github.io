#### *Work In Progress*

I'm a curious sort. If a system isn't performing as expected, you'll find me diving deep to get to the heart of the issue. My approach involves a deep dive into all layers of the OSI model, where I work to find the most efficient solution. I'm a firm believer that every problem has a solution; sometimes, it just takes a new point of view or a touch of creativity to uncover it.

Quick fixes aren't my style. I strive to eliminate vulnerabilities for good, building a secure, rock-solid environment that stands up to any challenge

Away from the professional sphere, I enjoy engaging in Capture The Flag events, running experiments in my home lab, and learning from any security loopholes I discover. My drive to grasp every detail of a process lets me tweak, strengthen, and fine-tune it for maximum security and performance. Plus, it's a great way to continually broaden my knowledge base.

Keeping up-to-date with the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape is important to me. That's why I regularly tune into industry experts like [NetworkChuck], [John Hammond], [Hak5], and [Hackersploit] on YouTube. They provide a wealth of knowledge that keeps me at the cutting edge of my field.
